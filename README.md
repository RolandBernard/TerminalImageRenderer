Implements a way to draw image buffers to termnal in C.
The implementation only supports terminals with true color and the ability to display
Unicode block characters.

For a more interesting test than the one that is provided in this repository, take look at the tir-example
branch of the SimpleGraphics repository: https://github.com/RolandBernard/SimpleGraphics/tree/tir-example:
